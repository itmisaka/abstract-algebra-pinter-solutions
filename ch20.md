# A. Characteristic of an Integral Domain

## Q1

*Let $a$ be any nonzero element of $A$. If $n \cdot a = 0$, where $n \neq 0$, then $n$ is a multiple of the characteristic of $A$.*

$$n \cdot a = 0 \implies n \cdot 1 = 0$$
but $\char(A) \cdot 1  = 0$, so $n$ is a multiple of the characteristic of $A$.

## Q2

*If $A$ has characteristic zero, $n \neq 0$, and $n \cdot a = 0$, then $a = 0$.*

$$n \neq 0$$
$$n \cdot a = 0$$
$$n \cdot 1 \cdot a = 0$$
but $n \cdot 1 \neq 0$ because characteristic is zero.
$$a = 0$$
by cancellation property.

## Q3

*If $A$ has characteristic $3$, and $5 \cdot a = 0$, then $a = 0$.*

$$3 \cdot a = 0$$
$$5 \cdot a = 3 \cdot a + 2 \cdot a = 2 \cdot a$$
$$2 \cdot a = 0 \implies a = 0$$

## Q4

*If there is a nonzero element $a$ in $A$ such that $256 \cdot a = 0$, then $A$ has characteristic $2$.*

$$256 = 2^8$$
characteristic is prime.
$$\char(A) = 2$$

## Q5

*If there are distinct nonzero elements $a$ and $b$ in $A$ such that $125 \cdot a = 125 \cdot b$, then $A$ has characteristic*

$$125 \cdot a = 125 \cdot b$$
$$5 \times 5 \cdot 1 \cdot (a - b) = 0$$
$$a \neq b \implies a - b \neq 0$$
$$5 \cdot 1 = 0$$
$$\char(A) = 5$$

## Q6

*If there are nonzero elements $a$ and in $A$ such that $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2$, then $A$ has characteristic $2$.*

Theorem 3: $(a + b)^p = a^p + b^p$

$$(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2$$
$$\char(A) = 2$$

## Q7

*If there are nonzero elements $a$ and $b$ in $A$ such that $10a = 0$ and $14b = 0$, then $A$ has characteristic $2$.*

$$2 \times 5 \cdot 1 \cdot a = 0$$
$$2 \times 7 \cdot 1 \cdot a = 0$$
$$2 \cdot 1 \cdot (5a + 7a) = 0$$
$$\char(A) = 2$$

# B. Characteristic of a Finite Integral Domain

## Q1

*If $A$ has characteristic $q$, then $q$ is a divisor of the order of $A$.*

By Lagrange's theorem, any subgroup divides the group order.

$1 + \cdots + 1 = 0$ and so forms a subgroup which divides the group order. The order of this subgroup is the characteristic of $A$.

See [this question](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1242993/prove-that-the-characteristic-of-a-finite-integral-domain-a-divides-the-order).

## Q2

*If the order of $A$ is a prime number $p$, then the characteristic of $A$ must be equal to $p$.*

From above the characteristic must divide the order, but the order is prime so the characteristic must equal $p$.

## Q3

*If the order of $A$ is $p^m$ , where $p$ is a prime, the characteristic of $A$ must be equal to $p$.*

The characteristic is prime and divides the order, hence $\char(A) = p$.

## Q4

$81 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3$, so by above $\char(A) = 3$.

## Q5

*If $A$, with addition alone, is a cyclic group, the order of $A$ is a prime number.*

$$A = \langle 1, + \rangle$$
$$\ord(1) = |A|$$
$$\ord(1) \cdot 1 = 0 = |A| \cdot 1$$
but
$$\char(1) \cdot 1 = 0$$
Hence $\char(1)| |A|$
But $\ord(1)$ is the smallest $n$ such that $\ord(1)\cdot 1 = 0$ so $\ord(1) | \char(1)$ by Lagrange, and $\ord(1) = |A|$

Thus $|A|$ is prime since $|A| = \char(1)$ which is also prime.
